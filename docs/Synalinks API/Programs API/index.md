# Programs API

Synalinks offers three methods to create programs, each tailored to different levels of complexity and use cases:

- **[Sequential Program](The%20Sequential%20class.md)**: This is the simplest method, involving a straightforward list of modules. Ideal for single-input, single-output stacks of modules. However, it is limited in flexibility compared to other methods.

- **[Functional Program](The%20Program%20class.md)**: This is a fully-featured API that supports arbitrary program architectures. Easy to use and suitable for most users, offering greater flexibility than the Sequential program.

- **[Program Subclassing](The%20Program%20class.md)**: This method allows you to implement everything from scratch. Ideal for complex or research use cases. It is also the preferred method for contributing.
